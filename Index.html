                        <p>Hello! My name is Lucas Davies and I am currently studying to become a Full Stack Developer through CodeAcademy and also studying BSc Computer Science and
                            Software with Open University.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have always had a love for computers and computing from a young age and have worked for 6 years in the Im&T department of Greater Manchester Mental Health.
                           I am hoping to achieve my goal of becoming a Full Stack developer in the not so distant future. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Along with this webpage, below are examples of projects I have developed.</p>
